# many things can go wrong with ec2 creating
# the CreationPolicy has a time out that causes the stack to rollback on error
# however, all of the logs are on the server
# so comment out the creation policy so that the ec2 instances stays around
# so that you can look at the logs

# there are two log locations
# one is /var/log/
# cloud-init.log - mostly initialization stuff
# cloud-init-output.log - mostly output of running, likely error are in here

# other location is the scripts that run
/var/lib/cloud/instance
